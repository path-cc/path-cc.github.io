    The Software Development Team supports, sustains, and enhances the [HTCondor
    Software Suite (HTCSS)](https://htcondor.org) to enable the potential of distributed High Throughput
    Computing. This suite of software tools includes HTCondor, components to build
    both on-premise HTCondor compute clusters for use by [independent academic,
    commercial, and government campuses](https://htcondor.org/about), and components to support the federation of
    processing and data resources across the OSG.

Software Development Team activities balance the inherent tension between the
desire for innovation, the expectation of stability and dependability for widely
adopted production software, and the immediate demands from our stakeholders.  

## Innovation Activity
A mix of non-stop evolving changes in technologies, user and application
requirements, and business models will provide a continuous stream of new
challenges and opportunities to the effectiveness of the HTCSS. To continue
providing a high level of value to the scientific community, HTCSS must evolve
through continuous enhancement and innovation. Our innovation activity works to
gather and define requirements from domain researchers and subsequently apply or
invent distributed processing patterns and mechanisms to tackle the challenges
of dHTC, while staying abreast of relevant industry and technology developments
to be leveraged.

## Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Packaging Activities
These activities are responsible for translating innovations into
production-quality, well-maintained, and documented open source software trusted
by organizations for wide-scale production deployment.

## Support and Use Activities
Our support activities include issue-tracked support from the developers,
management of open-source contributions, regular collaboration with large
facilities, and active participation by developers in community email lists and
workshops.  We recognize a key part of our translational research is to observe
the end-user and administrator user experience. As such, our use activities will
directly involve developers in the operation of a large, production dHTC
infrastructure at CHTC to function as a living lab for the team to understand
first-hand the strengths and weaknesses of their work, as well as obtain
feedback on the user experience.
