excerpt: |
    PATh is committed to openness in the science and institutions we support,
    in innovation of technologies and methodologies, and in interfaces to the
    broader ecosystem of NSF-funded CI services, especially as the fabric of
    coordination services evolves. To facilitate ingestion of ideas into HTCSS,
    and services into FoCaS, the Global Infrastructure Lab (GIL) tests and
    evaluate infrastructure software from inside and outside the partnership.

{{ page.excerpt }}

GIL maintains several testbeds, allowing the team to rapidly test
configurations. These dedicated testbeds are composed of volunteer partners
in the OSG Consortium providing service orchestration features. Virtual
testbeds are formed by overlaying the software to be evaluated onto
production resources and by using short-lived cloud bursts. These techniques
allow GIL to serve as a laboratory for services prior to introduction
within FoCaS. Within scope are major new versions of existing services as
well as new services slated to either expand or replace existing functionality.
GIL is thus positioned in PATh to act as a Technology Translation Service.
GIL also helps the PATh Software Development team identify software worth
interfacing with and ideas worth implementing and provide a platform for
scalability and usability evaluation of HTCSS components.

GIL focuses on features and products where it can make the most impact. On
top of software to adopt, GIL also explores ideas for implementation in HTCSS
and pointers to products with which HTCSS should interoperate.

GIL rapidly deploys new and updated services using a lightweight and highly
automated approach.  The GIL team is committed to collaborate with the XD
program, [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/), other national services like
[PRP](https://pacificresearchplatform.org/) and [SLATE](https://slateci.io/),
and public cloud providers. By leveraging these connections and other NSF-funded
national and global projects, PATh is positioned to innovate on the infrastructure
layer with benefits across the NSF CI ecosystem. 

GIL has proposed and led the discussion of the following ideas:
