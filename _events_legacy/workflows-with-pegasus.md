<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for our April 18th Workflows with Pegasus Training!</p>

Don't miss this opportunity to learn about optimizing your workflows using Pegasus on Tuesdays, April 18 from 2:30-4pm ET (11:30am - 1pm PT). 

Pegasus bridges the scientific domain and the execution environment by automatically mapping high-level workflow descriptions onto distributed resources. It automatically locates the necessary input data and computational resources necessary for workflow execution. Pegasus enables scientists to construct workflows in abstract terms without worrying about the details of the underlying execution environment or the particulars of the low-level specifications required by the middleware.

This workshop will also feature an exercise using text analysis and the next steps you can take to start your workflow.

**[Register here](https://osgfacilitation.setmore.com/bookclass)**

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST (and usually on Tuesdays). New User Training is offered monthly, generally on the first Tuesday of the month, and training on various additional topics happens on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG-Operated Access Point (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.

Other upcoming trainings:
- Tuesday, May 2: New User Training, **more information and registration coming soon.**
