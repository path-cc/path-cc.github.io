Office Hours will begin with a very short presentation on "Why is my site not running jobs? Examples, Answers, and Discussion." You'll also have a chance to get your burning questions of the day answered. We will be hosting breakout rooms for troubleshooting and finishing any site configurations. If you have any open tickets youâ€™d like to discuss with OSG staff, we especially encourage you to attend.
