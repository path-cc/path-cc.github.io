<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Save the Dates for the Joint HTCondor Week - OSG All-Hands Meeting - 10-14 July 2023</p>


Save the dates! For the first time, the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team, and the Center for High Throughput Computing will be hosting a Joint HTCondor Week - OSG All-Hands Meeting from July 10–14 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s [Fluno Center](https://fluno.com/).

Our hope is that this will primarily be an in-person event, but remote participation (via Zoom) for plenary events will also be offered. Required registration for both components will open in March 2023.

 If you register for and travel to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, you can attend plenary and non-plenary sessions, mingle with colleagues, and have planned or ad hoc meetings. In addition, evening events are planned throughout the week.

Topics  will include:
- Science Enabled by the OSPool and the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)
- OSG Technology
- HTCSS  Technology
- HTCSS and OSG Tutorials
- State of the OSG
- Campus  Services and Perspectives

For questions, please contact us at events@osg-htc.org or htcondor-week@cs.wisc.edu.
