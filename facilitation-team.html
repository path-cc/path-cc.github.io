<h2 id="what-we-do">What We Do</h2>

<p>To help researchers effectively utilize computing resources, our
Research Computing Facilitators (RCFs) not only guide the implementation of 
computational work on PATh-supported compute capacity, but can also
point researchers to other national services related to
research computing and data needs. </p>

<p>We are available to answer questions via an email “ticket” system. We
aim to provide a first response (although not necessarily a solution!)
within 1-2 business days.</p>

<p>In addition to email, we host drop-in “office hours” online twice a
week. No appointment is needed, just show up during the available times!
Contact us for the zoom link. </p>

<p>All of these details are on our Get Help page. </p>

and hosts an annual in-person summer school, the OSG School. </p>
